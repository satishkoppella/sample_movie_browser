Build a page that has a text box to search for a movie and a button to search

The user would enter the name of a movie and hit the button

Got all the details of the movie by calling the API at http://www.omdbapi.com <http://www.omdbapi.com/>http://www.omdbapi.com/

Displayed the details about the movie on the page in a nicely formatted way

Used React framework and Bootstrap for CSS and formatting.
